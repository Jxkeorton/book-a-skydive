### Version Control

The site was created using the Visual Studio Code editor and pushed to github to the remote repository ‘book-a-skydive’.

The following git commands were used throughout development to push code to the remote repo:

```git add <file>``` - This command was used to add the file(s) to the staging area before they are committed.

```git commit -m “commit message”``` - This command was used to commit changes to the local repository queue ready for the final step.

```git push``` - This command was used to push all committed code to the remote repository on github.

### Heroku Deployment

The site was deployed to Heroku. The steps to deploy are as follows:

- Navigate to heroku and create an account
- Click the new button in the top right corner
- Select create new app
- Enter app name
- Select region and click create app
- Click the resources tab and search for Heroku Postgres

- Go to the settings tab and then click reveal config vars
- Add the following config vars:
  - SECRET_KEY: (Your secret key)

- Open your IDE of choice (git must be installed for the next steps)
- Type git clone copied-git-url into the IDE terminal

The project will now have been cloned on your local machine for use.

### Fork Project

Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.

- Navigate to the GitHub Repository you want to fork.

- On the top right of the page under the header, click the fork button.

- This will create a duplicate of the full project in your GitHub Repository.
